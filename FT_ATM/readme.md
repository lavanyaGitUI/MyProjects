A Fault-Tolerant ATM, which detects and tolerates the errors in the ATM system. The ATM system provides users with the basic ATM services â€“ Withdraw Funds and Check balance. The ATM system is structured into an ATM client component, an ATM server component, and a synchronous connector between the client and the server components. The server component is the unit of mitigation for fault tolerance, but the ATM client component and the connector are the not the units of mitigation. The ATM server component is monitored using Heartbeat pattern and recovered the errors using Failover pattern. Developed in JAVA
